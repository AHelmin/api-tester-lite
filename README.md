# API Tester Lite - WIP

## Vision

Build a polished, browser‑based mini‑Postman that lets users craft HTTP requests, send them, and inspect responses. Features to include a user-friendly UI, saved history, and a tiny demo backend so it always works live. Intent with this project is to show full‑stack skills (React + TypeScript + Node/Serverless + CI/CD).
