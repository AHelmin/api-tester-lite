# API Tester Lite (WIP)

## Overview

API Tester Lite is a work-in-progress web application designed to provide an interface for testing REST APIs directly in the browser.

The goal is to support common CRUD operations in a clean, minimal UI, similar to tools like Postman, but simplified for quick testing and demos.

## Planned Features

* Execute basic REST requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* View formatted request and response data
* Optional user accounts to store limited request history
* Guest mode for quick, no-signup testing

## Status

Still under active development. Functionality and Ui are still evolving.
